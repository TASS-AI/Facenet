# TASS Facenet Classifier

[![TASS Facenet Classifier](images/facenet.jpg)](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet)

[![UPCOMING RELEASE](https://img.shields.io/badge/UPCOMING%20RELEASE-0.1.1-blue.svg)](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet/tree/1.1)

The **TASS Facenet Classifier** uses Siamese Neural Networks and Triplet Loss to classify known and unknown faces, basically this means it calculates the distance between an image it is presented and a folder of known faces. 

The project uses an **UP2 (Up Squared)** (A regular Linux desktop or Raspberry 3 and above will also work) the **Intel Movidius** for inference and the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotjumpway.tech "iotJumpWay") for IoT connectivity. 

With previous versions of TASS built using Tensorflow, **TASS Movidius Inception V3 Classifier**, the model had issues with the [Openset Recognition Issue](https://www.wjscheirer.com/projects/openset-recognition/ "Openset Recognition Issue"). **TASS Facenet Classifier** uses a directory of known images and when presented with a new image, will loop through each image basically measuring the distance between the known image and the presented image, it seems to overcome the issue so far in small testing environments of one or more people. In a large scenario this method will not be scalable, but is fine for small home projects etc. 

Combining **TASS Movidius Inception V3 Classifier** (prone to open set recognition issues) and **TASS Facenet Classifier** will allow us to catch false positives and verify positive classifications using the name/ID of that prediction to quickly index into the images and make a single calculation to determine if Inception classified the person correctly or not using Facenet and making the project more scalable. The latest Inception version of the classifier will be uploaded to this repository soon.

# Install NCSDK On Development Device

![Intel® Movidius](images/movidius.jpg)

The first thing you will need to do is to install the **NCSDK** on your development device.

```
 $ mkdir -p ~/workspace
 $ cd ~/workspace
 $ git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
 $ cd ~/workspace/ncsdk
 $ make install
```

Next plug your Movidius into your device and issue the following commands:

```
 $ cd ~/workspace/ncsdk
 $ make examples
```

# Cloning The Repo

You will need to clone this repository to a location on your development terminal. Navigate to the directory you would like to download it to and issue the following commands.

    $ git clone https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet.git

Once you have the repo, you will need to find the files in this folder located in [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet").

# Setup

Now you need to setup the software required for the classifier to run. The setup.sh script is a shell script that you can run on both your development device and Raspberry Pi 3 / UP Squared device. 

Make sure you have installed the **NCSDK** on your developement machine, the following command assumes you are located in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory.

The setup.sh file is an executable shell script that will do the following:

- Install the required packages named in **requirements.txt**
- Downloads the pretrained Facenet model (**davidsandberg/facenet**)
- Downloads the pretrained **Inception V3** model
- Converts the **Facenet** model to a model that is compatible with the **Intel® Movidius**

To execute the script, enter the following command:

```
 $ sh setup.sh
```

If you have problems running the above program and have errors try run the following command before executing the shell script. You may be getting errors due to the shell script having been edited on Windows, the following command will clean the setup file.

```
 $ sed -i 's/\r//' setup.sh
 $ sh setup.sh
```

# iotJumpWay Device Connection Credentials & Settings

Setup an iotJumpWay Location Device for IDC Classifier, ensuring you set up a camera node, as you will need the ID of the dummy camera for the project to work. Once your create your device add the location ID and Zone ID to the **IoTJumpWay** details in the confs file located at **required/confs.json**, also add the device ID and device name exactly, add the MQTT credentials to the **IoTJumpWayMQTT** .

You will need to edit your device and add the rules that will allow it to communicate autonomously with the other devices and applications on the network, but for now, these are the only steps that need doing at this point.

Follow the [iotJumpWay Dev Program Location Device Doc](https://www.iotjumpway.tech/developers/getting-started-devices "iotJumpWay Dev Program Location Device Doc") to set up your devices.

```

        "Threshold": 1.20
    }
}
```

# Preparing Dataset

You need to set up two very small datasets. As we are using a pretrained Facenet model there is no training to do in this tutorial and we only need one image per known person. You should see the **known** and **testing** folders in the **data** directory, this is where you will store 1 image of each person you want to be identified by the network, and also a testing dataset that can include either known or unknown faces for testing. When you store the known data, you should name each image with the name you want them to be identified as in the system, in my testing I used images of me and two other random people, the 1 image used to represent myself in the known folder was named Adam  

# Test TASS Facenet Classifier

Now it is time to test out your classifier, on your development machine in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory:


```
 $ python3.5 Classifier.py
```

This will run the classifier test program, the program will first loop through your testing images, and once it sees a face it will loop through all of the known faces and match them against the faces, once it finds a match, or not, it will move on to the next image in your testing loop until all images have been classifier as known or unknown. 

```
-- Total Difference is: 1.7931939363479614
-- NO MATCH
-- Total Difference is: 0.8448524475097656
-- MATCH Adam-2.jpg
```

# Run TASS Facenet Classifier On WebCam

Now comes the good part, realtime facial recognition and identification. 

![TASS Facenet Classifier](images/capture.jpg)

**WebCam.py** should connect to the local webcam on your device, process the frames and send them to a local server that is started by this same program. Be sure to edit the **ID** and **Name** values of the **Cameras** section of **required/confs.json** section using the details provided when setting up the configs, and add the URL of the IP of your device ie: http://192.168.1.200 to the **Stream** value and you can change **StreamPort** to whatever you want. These two fields will determine the address that you access your camera on, using the previous IP (Stream) and the StreamPort as 8080 the address would be **http://192.168.1.200:8080/index.html**.

```
"Cameras": [
{
    "ID": 0,
    "URL": 0,
    "Name": "",
    "Stream": "",
    "StreamPort": 8080
}
```

The program uses a **dlib** model to recognize faces in the frames / mark the facial points on the frame, and **Facenet** to determine whether they are a known person or not. Below are the outputs around the time that the above photo was taken. You will see that the program publishes to the **Warnings** channel of the iotJumpWay, this is currently the name for the channel that handles device to device communication via rules.

```
-- Saved frame
-- Total Difference is: 1.0537698864936829
-- MATCH
-- Published: 30
-- Published to Device Warnings Channel
```

# Install NCSDK On UP Squared / Raspberry Pi 3

![UP2](images/UPSquared.jpg)

If you would like to use the IDC Classifier on the edge, this tutorial has been tested on the **UP2** and the **Raspberry Pi**. You can install the **NCSDK** on your **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3** device, this will be used by the classifier to carry out inference on local images or images received via the API we will create. Make sure you have the Movidius plugged in to the edge device and follow the guide below:

```
 $ mkdir -p ~/workspace
 $ cd ~/workspace
 $ git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
 $ cd ~/workspace/ncsdk/api/src
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
```
```
 $ cd ~/workspace
 $ git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo
 $ cd ncappzoo/apps/hello_ncs_py
 $ python3 hello_ncs.py
```

# Upload File Structure To UP Squared / Raspberry Pi 3

Now you need to upload the required files to the UP Squared / Raspberry Pi 3. Copy the **TASS-Facenet** directory from your **development machine** to your **UP Squared / Raspberry Pi 3** then navigate to the home directory of the project on your device and run the following command.  
```
 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

# Use TASS Facenet Classifier on UP Squared / Raspberry Pi 3

You can use the **TASS Facenet Classifier** on **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3** by entering the following command in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory of your **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3**:

```
 $ python3.5 Classifier.py
```
# Process / Stream TASS Facenet Classifier WebCam

**WebCam.py** connects to a local webcam on your device or IP cam, processes the frames and sends them to a local server that is started by this same program. Be sure to edit the **ID** and **Name** values of the **Cameras** section of **required/confs.json** section using the details provided when setting up the configs, and add the URL of the IP of your device ie: http://192.168.1.200 to the **Stream** value and you can change **StreamPort** to whatever you want. These two fields will determine the address that you access your camera on, using the previous IP (Stream) and the StreamPort as 8080 the address would be **http://192.168.1.200:8080/index.html**.

You can process / stream a webcam using the **TASS Facenet Classifier** on **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3** by entering the following command in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory of your **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3**:

```
 $ python3.5 WebCam.py
```

# Launch TASS Facenet Classifier Server

**Server.py** will launch a local server that will make the TASS Facenet Classifier accessible as an API endpoint on your local network. The next step is to use the provided client to send images to this API, but you can also use this for Desktop / Mobile applications and other IoT devices /  applications.

For extra security it is also possible to add an **A record** to your web domain's DNS Zone pointing a sub domain to your public IP, then with port forwarding you can forward requests to the IP/Port of the API, combining this with services such as LetsEncrypt will allow you to send requests to your API from the outside world over an encrypted connection. 

You can start the **TASS Facenet Classifier** on **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3** by entering the following command in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory of your **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3**:

```
 $ python3.5 Server.py
```

Now leave this connection and open a new terminal session to your device.

# Send Images To API 

The final program of this project allows you to send testing images from the **data/testing/** directory to the API for classification.

You can start sending images to **TASS Facenet Classifier Server** on **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3** by entering the following command in the [TASS-Facenet](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS-Facenet") directory of your **UP Squared** / **Raspberry Pi 3**:

```
 $ python3.5 Client.py
```
